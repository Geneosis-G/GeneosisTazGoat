[quote=About this mod]This mod was requested by FeatherButtRaptor in a discussion of the ZGG mod page, and the first thing I thought about it is that it would be really fun but impossible to control.
After trying (and failing) to make some other mods I had in mind, I tried to do this one and noticed that it may be possible to make it controllable by changing the time scale of the goat, and after many tweaks I managed to get a spinning goat that could move in the direction you press.
Anyway one big problem was still there: as long as the goat was on the ground, the spin speed was really slow (because of collisions with the ragdoll). I fixed this issue by adding a little hover effect on the goat to make it float close to the ground without touching it.
Finally, the destructive power of the spinning goat was really bad and the spin was stopped by almowt anything you hit, so I had to find another way to destroy the stuff you touch... And for that used an old method I created with the APM mod: I generated invisible explosions around the goat body to destroy everything in a close radius.
